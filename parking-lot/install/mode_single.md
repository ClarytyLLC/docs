# Install Single Mode

1. Become root
    ```bash
    sudo bash
    ```

2. Set the variables
    ```bash

    export AIWARE_MODE=single
    export AIWARE_DB_PORT=5432 # if PG is running locally
    export AIWARE_CACHE=/opt/aiware/cache
    export AIWARE_DB_ROOT=/opt/aiware/postgres
    export AIWARE_REGISTRY_ROOT=/opt/aiware/registry
    export AIWARE_REGION=us-east-1 # only relevant if running in AWS
    export AIWARE_HOST_EXPIRE=false
    export AIWARE_INIT_TOKEN=`uuidgen` # generate a random UUID for edge token
    export AIWARE_CONTROLLER=http://IP_OF_NODE:9000/edge/v1 # primary ip of the node
    ```
3. Run install command

    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.aiware.com | sh -
    ```

    This will install the aiware-agent as a service.  You can check the status via running `service aiware-agent status` command.

4. Validate install

    Run: docker ps -a . This should show the aiware-prom-alertmgr, aiware-prometheus, cadvisor, aiware-controller, aiware-postgres, & aiware-registry.

    You can connect to the database at localhost:5342, or whichever port that you have specified for AIWARE_DB_PORT, with postgres/postgres as the username/password.

    Run: docker logs -tf aiware-controller, to see the activity of aiware-controller.

    Go to http://<HOST>:9000/edge/v1/version, or curl localhost:9000/edge/v1/version, for aiWARE Edge version information.  This will return information such as :
