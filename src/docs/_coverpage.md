Veritone's aiWARE platform is purpose-built for extensibility.
Our developer community is the lifeblood of the aiWARE platform, enabling it to expand organically through the addition of new capabilities and functionality.
Whether your goal is to build new cognitive engines, leverage existing ones, or create never-before-seen solutions through integration of custom and existing modules, we can help.
