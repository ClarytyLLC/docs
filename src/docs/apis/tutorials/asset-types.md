# Asset Types

When you create assets on a temporal data object (TDO), you are required to specify an `assetType`.
aiWARE supports the following values for the `assetType` field:

| Asset Type | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `media` | Used for anything thatâ€™s a file that could be processed. A TDO can have more than one `media` asset to represent various copies of the file or ancillary versions of the original file. When a TDO is processed, the asset that will be used for processing is determined by which of the `media` assets is identified as the `primaryMedia(type: "asset")`. |
| `media-mdp` | This is the HLS or MPEG-DASH format of the media. |
| `text` | This is a text file.  This will be used for translation. A TDO can have more than one `text` asset to represent various copies of the file or ancillary versions of the original file. |
| `vtn-standard` | Used for engine output documents. See the [engine output standard](/developer/engines/standards/engine-output/) section for information. |
| `thumbnail` | Used for storing lower-resolution image thumbnail previews of media files.  The default thumbnail that is displayed in CMS and other apps is based on the value of the TDO's `thumbnailUrl` property. |
| `content-template` | TDO content templates are extra metadata appended to a TDO. The contents of each `content-template` asset will conform to a particular schema designated by `asset.sourceData.schema`. |
| `transcript` | A legacy asset type used for storing TTML transcripts. Do not use this type; use `vtn-standard` instead. |

## Custom Asset Types

You can define your own custom asset types by simply writing an asset with a type value beginning with `x-` (e.g. `x-my-asset-type`).
This will allow you to save asset types specific to your custom workflows and applications.
No special handling will be applied to assets whose type begins with `x-`.

## Content Types

Content Types are the Media Types that are defined by IANA at [https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)

## Reading Assets

While it is sometimes necessary to read asset metadata through the [assets] query and access the asset contents directly by downloading the file present at the asset's `signedUri`,
more often you will want to use higher-level APIs to access the information stored in assets.

- For accessing **audio and video media**, the signedUri returned for the primary media asset is often a reference to our `media-streamer`,
our DASH/HLS-compatible media streaming service that can be used to clip and stitch files and streams.
- For accessing **engine output**, use the [engineResults](/apis/reference/query/?id=engineresults) query.
It normalizes multiple versions of engine output to our most recent standard and can retrieve time-based sections of content.
- For accessing **thumbnails**, use the `temporalDataObject.thumbnail` property, which will return a signed URI.

### Accessing the Media-Streamer

The media-streamer service is a secure service since it contains proprietary content. If you
attempt to access a file without authorization, you will get a 401 response code. In order to
access content on the media-streamer, you will need to provide a session token in the
Authorization header.

You can get a session token in several ways, but the most common ones are by logging in via
GraphQL with the `userLogin` mutation or, if you are creating an engine, then a token generated
for the engine's current session will be provided to you as part of the request to process
content.

**Example:**

To access the primary media asset for a TDO, you might get the URL with this GraphQL:

```
query {
	temporalDataObject(id:1550065668) {
    primaryAsset(assetType:"media") {
      id
      signedUri
    }
  }
}
```

Which will return something like

```
{
  "data": {
    "temporalDataObject": {
      "primaryAsset": {
        "id": "VlRBOm1lZGlhOjE1NTAwNjU2Njg=",
        "signedUri": "https://api.veritone.com/media-streamer/download/tdo/1550065668"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Accessing this directly gives a 401:

```
$ curl -I "https://api.veritone.com/media-streamer/download/tdo/1550065668"
HTTP/2 401 
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
...
```
and the body of the response contains `missing header`

To access the content, provide an Authorization token along with the request:

```
$ curl -I \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer afd7f3f9-a79e-4a47-92bf-a83ffb8bfb28" \
  "https://api.veritone.com/media-streamer/download/tdo/1550065668"           
HTTP/2 200 
content-type: audio/mpeg
```
