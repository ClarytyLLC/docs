## aiware-agent core engine build deploy

Updates a build until it is deploed

### Synopsis

Examines a build's current status and checks to see if it can be deployed. If the
build is in a status with a path to deployment, then a series of updates will be
sent until it is deployed. If the build is in a status that cannot be deployed
(like 'deleted' or 'disapproved') then an error will be reported. Calling this
is exactly equivalent to calling build update multiple times until the build is
deployed.
