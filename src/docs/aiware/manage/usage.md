# Usage Reporting for Air-Gapped Environments

To report usage for truly isolated and air-grapped aiWARE, please run the following:

```bash
# Run as root on DB server

curl -sfl get.aiware.com/usage.sh > /opt/aiware/usage.sh
chmod a+x /opt/aiware/usage.sh
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "14 */4 * * * /opt/aiware/usage.sh") | crontab -
```

## Sending the Reports

```bash
cd /opt/aiware/reports
tar -czf reports-`date %Y%M%d%H`.tgz /opt/aiware/reports

# Optionally removing the old reports
rm /opt/aiware/reports/*.out
```

Then copy the `/opt/aiware/reports/reports-*.tgz` file to a computer and email the file to your account manager.
