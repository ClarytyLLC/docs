# Get Started with Application Development

## Build an AI-Powered App on aiWARE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence in a custom app is easier than you think. Choose from hundreds of cognitive engines (covering more than 25 cognitive capabilities) to build an AI solution to solve challenging business problems. Leverage aiWARE's built-in asset management functionality to build access-controlled, rich-media web apps in record time.

## App Development Quickstart <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

To build your own application that integrates with aiWARE, use [the quickstart](https://docs.veritone.com/#/developer/applications/quick-start).

To build a pre-planned app we provide the code for, use the full [step-by-step tutorial](https://docs.veritone.com/#/developer/applications/app-tutorial/).

## Visit the Veritone Developer Portal <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The [Veritone Developer](https://developer.veritone.com/engines/overview) application lets you build and test applications in a point-and-click environment. After your app is deployed, members of your organization can log in and use whatever functionalities you've provisioned for them. Get modular UI elements, data ingestion, metadata storage, search functionality, and more, automatically.
