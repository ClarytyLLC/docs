# Automate Studio Application
**APPROXIMATE READING TIME: 2 MINUTES**

?>Veritone Automate Studio is a low-code workflow designer that empowers technical and business teams to tap into a full-stack AI architecture to design and deploy AI-powered business processes at scale in days, not months. Leverage an intuitive drag-and-drop UI to easily create advanced business logic on a digital canvas, without the need for in-depth coding skills or AI expertise. Automate Studio enables intelligent process automation (IPA) and workflow enrichment across both new and existing systems and applications.


### Prerequisites for Using Automate Studio

There's nothing to install. Automate Studio runs as a web app. To use Automate Studio, you simply need:

1.  An active Automate Studio account. (Sign up [here](https://www.veritone.com/onboarding/#/signUp?type=automate) to create an account and gain immediate access to the application.)
2.  Access to the internet &mdash; Automate Studio is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)  application that runs in Veritone's Commercial or GovCloud environments. 

In this section we will cover the basic concepts of the **Automate Studio App** or **Flow Editor**

### Overview

- [Canvas](#canvas)
- [Node Palette](#node-palette)
- [Debug/Info](#debug-info)

### Canvas

Canvas is the gridded workspace in the center of the Automate Studio App, in which we can design and optionally run flows within Automate Studio. It is organized by tabs located at the top, one for each individual flow. No setup is required, but some basic settings are available at *File* -> *Settings*.

### Node Palette

Available node types are shown vertically in a Node Palette on the left side of the workspace. Nodes are organized into sections that can be expanded or rolled up accordion-style.

Use the *File* -> *Manage Palette* menu command to enable/disable, add, remove, or update nodes. 

A search bar is available on the top of the palette to simplify the nodes filtering and searching. 


### Debug / Info

Information about the currently selected node is shown in a resizable Sidebar on the right. Note that the Sidebar can display an Info panel, or a Debug panel. (Choose the view by clicking the i or bug icon buttons at the top right.)
