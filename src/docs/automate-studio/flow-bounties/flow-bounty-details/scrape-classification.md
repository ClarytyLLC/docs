# Scrape Classification

[status/Development/Undeveloped/red]


## Overview {docsify-ignore}
As a CMS/GraphQL user, I can create a job that invokes an Automation engine to scrape a website and process the content for either topic extraction or content classification (or both!) 

## Details {docsify-ignore}
Acceptance criteria are as follows:

1. As a user, I can provide a site url to scrape
2. As a user, I can select one or more actions (topic extraction, content classification, etc.). I can specify this control as a parameter in an engine input field.
3. As a user, I can provide an email address for results to be sent to.

Hint: we can reference and use this node.js engine which achieves a similar outcome - task-analytics-pdf-generator
