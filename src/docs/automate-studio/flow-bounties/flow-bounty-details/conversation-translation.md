# Call Center Conversation Translation 
[status/Development/Undeveloped/red]


## Overview <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Transcribe and translate conversations in near real-time to enable follow-up or intervention by agents who donâ€™t speak the language. 
## Details <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Input a live stream of a call, run through a transcription engine, then through a language detection engine (alternatively, take the language as a config input), and finally through a translation engine (output language is a config parameter). Put results back in the Call Center system.
