title: Step 3. Build your app using Veritone's APIs
---

Veritone provides intelligent APIs that allow you to to easily add intelligent features – such as object detection, face recognition, and transcription – into your application. Once your app has been created and provisioned for OAuth authentication, you’ll use Veritone's API to access functionality, execute operations, and retrieve the data you need.

-----------------

Veritone provides a GraphQL API for interacting with our services. GraphQL is a querying language that enables you to make a single call to fetch the information you need instead of several REST requests.
