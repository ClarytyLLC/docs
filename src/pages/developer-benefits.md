Veritone has developed a robust developer ecosystem designed to enable cognitive engine, custom application, and data product developers to monetize their intellectual property in an efficient manner.  We rely on developer partners as a critical component of the Veritone business model

Veritone plays the critical roles of aggregating specialized engines across the cognitive spectrum, continuously developing and improving the Veritone aiWARE Platform, and marketing our flexible, future-proof, and easy-to-use platform to significant clients across industries on an international scale through our significant marketing and sales efforts.

As a developer, Veritone provides an important distribution channel for your software products without the need to create all of the "plumbing" of a full software stack, or the need to directly market and sell to end-clients.  If you choose, you can simply focus on developing killer algorithms, data sets, or applications on top of our stack.

We also welcome companies with established businesses and existing direct or indirect sales channels.  Veritone should be viewed as an incremental monetization channel, and for engine developers in particular we do this on a white-label basis so as not to interfere with other channels or create pricing conflict.

Our ecosystem has already provided significant and tangible revenue to partners, in fact several of our partners have generated well over $1 Million per based on the millions of media hours we process and the multiplying factor of utilizing several engines simultaneously for most clients.

As a developer partner in the Veritone Ecosystem, there are several ways to earn revenue from your software products:

### Engine Developers ###

We compensate engine developers based on variable engine usage, measured in either hours of media processed or API calls made.  Rates are negotiated with each partner, and we prefer tiered pricing based on volume.  We are open to discussing other models as well, including flat fees, but we generally prefer a variable cost structure.  A typical tiered structure would look like this:

0-1,000 hours = $Z

1,000-10,000 hours = $Z x 90%

10,000 - 100,000 hours = $Z x 75%

100,000 - 1 million hours = $Z x $60%

Over 1 million hours = $Z x 50%

(Discounts are illustrative and subject to negotiation)

Veritone&rsquo;s proprietary technology stack includes Conductor, a machine learning software layer that optimizes results by automatically choosing the best cognitive engine(s) for each processing job based on the combination of accuracy, speed, and cost constraints determined by our clients.  Accuracy is determined by comparative benchmarking across each cognitive class.  Conductor is currently an optional feature available only for transcription, but it will continue to expand to other cognitive classes (intraclass Conductor) and across cognitive classes (interclass Conductor) over time.

Otherwise, Veritone generally guides its clients to the best engine(s) for each job based on known accuracy, engine output capabilities, deployment model required, processing speed (measured as a proportion of the original media run time) and cost.  Actual processing volume will depend on the number of clients that try and ultimately use the service.

In addition, Veritone operates a substantial pubic media index of television, radio, podcast, and web video processing thousands of hours of media per day.  We continue to add more cognitive processing to this media over time and select the engines to run against this processing volume on the same basis as our clients - speed, accuracy, and cost.  PMI is often a testbed for new engines to understand capabilities and accuracy over a spectrum of media.

Developer partners must choose the type of deployment for each engine build e.g. Cloud API, On Premise, Hybrid, or Human.  Keep in mind that in the case of Cloud API, the developer partner is bearing the compute cost, while in other deployment models Veritone bears this cost so the price for on-premise deployment should be lower than cloud to account for the shift in compute expenses.

Veritone calculates the license fees generated from each individual data processing job, and aggregates this for reporting on a monthly basis.  We intend to soon have developer dashboards that will enable you to view processing hours and license fees for each day.

Veritone will generally pay its partners for each month's processing volume by the end of the following month.  This process will become increasingly automated over time.

### Application Developers ###

Veritone enables custom application developers to build unique apps on top of our technology platform via a suite of APIs.  Developers can take advantage not only of Veritone's leading cognitive processing capabilities across classes, but also modular elements of our standard UI, data and metadata storage, search functionality and other features.

We will soon be launching the Veritone Marketplace - a hub for developers to offer their applications directly to Veritone customers on a SaaS model basis.  Applications can be offered in three ways:

- Monthly SaaS model, as an upcharge to the core Veritone platform.  This could be based on a seat license basis, or as a single license fee to each client organization.
- Free Saas model
- One-time license fee

Application developer partners are entitled to two revenue streams - 65% of any application licensing revenue collected by Veritone (either monthly or one-time), and 7% of ongoing engine processing fees that are utilized by the application in question.

Veritone will collect all application and engine revenues and remit revenue sharing on a monthly basis to application partners.

### Data Product Developers ###

The business model for Data Product developers will continue to evolve over time.  Similar to our construct for engines, we expect to offer negotiated license fees with data product vendors either based on variable usage or a flat fees under the expectation that such developers make their products available via adaptors/connectors running in a Docker container.
