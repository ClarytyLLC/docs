Veritone maintains open-source engines that serve as working examples of how engines are to be written and packaged.

We encourage you to read through them, fork them, and even submit pull requests with your suggestions/improvements.

New sample engines in other languages will be added here in the coming weeks. Be sure to check back soon!
