title: Quickstart
---

This quick start is designed to take you through the engine development lifecycle as quickly as possible. Upon completion, you'll have completed the necessary steps to build and deploy your engine in the Veritone Platform.

**How is the Quick Start Organized?**

The engine development quick start is divided into seven tutorials that should be completed in order. Because some of the steps require testing and review, the time to complete the steps can vary. However, you can stop at any step in the process and pick up where you left off when you&rsquo;re ready.

* Step 1: Create an Engine
* Step 2: Construct Your Code for the Veritone Platform
* Step 3: Create an Engine Manifest File
* Step 4: Package and Upload an Engine Build
* Step 5: Submit a Build for Approval
* Step 6: Deploy an Engine
* Step 7: Manage an Active Engine or Build
