title: Step 5 - Submit a Build for Approval
---

After your build has passed the compliance testing and is in the *Available* state, the next step is to submit it to Veritone for review by one of our team members. The review process may take up to a business day to complete. Once reviewed, your build status will change to *Approved* or *Disapproved*. If your build is *Approved*, it&rsquo;s eligible to participate in the Veritone ecosystem and can be  at any time. If your was *Disapproved*, it cannot be deployed to production. Please contact our [support team](mailto:devsupport@veritone.com) for more information.
