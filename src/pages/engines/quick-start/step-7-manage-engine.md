#### Pausing Your Build

If for any reason, you want to pause a deployed build, you can simply click on Pause underneath the vertical ellipses. Pausing a build will prevent the build from being selected for any new jobs. Existing jobs, including queued jobs, may continue to process.

#### Disabling Your Engine

Engines with a deployed build are marked as Active in the UI. Active engines can be disabled by clicking on the Disable action. Disabling an engine will pause any deployed builds for that engine as well.

#### Editing Your Engine

You can edit your engine details or deployment model at any time by clicking on the Edit action on the All Engines page, provided that the engine is any state under than Active or Deleted. Active engines are already available to users and so cannot be changed. If you wish to change the engine details or deployment model of an existing Active engine, please create a new engine and a new build, and then disable the existing engine.
