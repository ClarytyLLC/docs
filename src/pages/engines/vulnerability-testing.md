title: Vulnerability Testing
---

When an engine is submitted to Veritone, there are a number of tests we run against the engine to make sure it is ready for prime-time on our platform. One of these tests performs static analysis of vulnerabilities in your Docker container.

This analysis produces a list of [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) detected in the container. If we detect vulnerabilities in an engine build, they will be included for you to review in the Build Report in the `vulnerabilities` array (see example below).

Engine builds will only be marked invalid if we detect vulnerabilities labeled as "Critical" - anything below this level of severity will not prevent your engine from being made available, but will still be included for your review in the build report.

If you would like to test a container for vulnerabilities on your own, check out [Clairs'](https://coreos.com/clair/docs/latest/) [getting started guide](https://github.com/coreos/clair/blob/master/Documentation/running-clair.md).
