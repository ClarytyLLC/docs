title: Object Series Data
---

Object Series Data is a standardized yet flexible JSON format that can accommodate many different types of engine outputs.  

Object Data types apply to logo, landscapes, vehicles, and other visual object detection types.

The output asset generated by the engine should take the form of a JSON file containing relevant information fields. Fields are included in a "series" array, where each JSON object represents an object found in the media. Each identified entity should be represented as an object with the time series associated with the appearance in the input file.

## Recognized Fields ##

Fields that are recognized are listed below.

|Fields|Type|Description|Example|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|series|array|An array of series objects. The objects are sorted by start value.|``````|

### Series ###

|Fields|Type|Description|Example|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|found|string|A label for the object detected. Please create a new series item for each object detected.|```"minivan"```|
|start|integer|The time in milliseconds from the beginning of the file where the object was first identified.|```3375```|
|end|integer|The time in milliseconds from the beginning of the file where the object was last identified.|```5875```|
|confidence|rounded integer|A probability score related to the recognition. Please provide a whole number confidence score from 0 to 1000. It should be rounded, not truncated. |```763```|
