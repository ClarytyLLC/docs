title: Engine Manifest
---

## Overview

Every container uploaded to Veritone for an engine should include a manifest.json file, which contains important information about your engine and build. Veritone relies on the information in the manifest to correctly operate the engine on our platform, so please be as accurate and comprehensive as you can. Omitting the manifest.json file or neglecting to use the proper engineId will result in your build not being registered with the system. If you have pushed an engine to our Docker registry and it is not showing up, check that your manifest is properly formatted and stored in the correct location (/var/manifest.json).

## Format

Manifest files should be written in JSON format. We expect the manifest to be stored in your container as /var/manifest.json - this should be done in your Dockerfile ([example](https://github.com/veritone/vda-sample-engine-py/blob/master/Dockerfile#L6)).

## Fields

The fields that should be included in manifest.json are listed in the table below. Please include all fields indicated as being required. If fields are missing, we may invalidate your container or in some cases, assume the default values. Fields that are not marked as being required are optional; they should be included in the manifest file if you have any values to declare but may be omitted if you don't.
