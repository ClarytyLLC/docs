## Challenge 1: Build and Deploy a Cognitive Engine on an OS for AI

> Show off your technical skill and imagination by building or integrating 
> a cognitive engine and deploying it via our Veritone Developer application 
> onto the Veritone aiWARE platform.

[The engine quickstart guide](/engines/quick-start/step-1-create-an-engine/)
will walk you through all the steps of creating an A.I. engine and uploading
it to Veritone's platform.

You can find a list of our [sample engines here](/engines/sample-engines/) to
give you a reference.

## Challenge 2: Build an Innovative AI-Powered Application on an OS for AI

> Show off your technical skill and imagination by building or integrating 
> an application experience leveraging one of the cognitive engine categories 
> in the Veritone Ecosystem via API and deploying it within our Veritone 
> Developer application.

#### Option 1: Start an app from scratch

The easiest way to build a Veritone-powered web app is to start from our 
sample React app.  If you're comfortable building a web app with React,
just `git clone` our [sample React app](https://github.com/veritone/veritone-sample-app-react)
and follow the instructions in the [Quick Start section of the README](https://github.com/veritone/veritone-sample-app-react#quick-start).

#### Option 2: Integrate into an existing app

If you'd like to integrate with another framework or platform (e.g. mobile) or have 
an existing app you'd like to add Veritone services to, the easiest way is to 
[create an API token](/apis/authentication/) and start making calls through our 
[GraphQL interface](/apis/using-graphql/).

Alternatively, if you're comfortable implementing your own OAuth2 flow, 
you can [create an application](/applications/quick-start/step-1/) in the 
Veritone Developer app and use the OAuth flow to get tokens on a user-by-user 
basis.

#### Useful Tutorials

Regardless of which method of integration you choose, the following tutorials will
likely prove useful:

Happy coding!
