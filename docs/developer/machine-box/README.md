# Welcome to Machine Box

Machine Box allows you to integrate, deploy and scale Machine Learning capabilities fast, on-prem or in the cloud.

## What is Machine Box?

With Machine Box, you can utilize powerful artifical intelligence and machine learning
capabilities without a science degree. We do all that data science and model training
for you, and wrap it up into a Docker image that you can deploy once or a million times,
on-prem, or in the cloud.

## Welcome to docs

We'll try and keep this documentation light and to the point, and it mostly contains tutorials,
articles, hints and tips for how to make the most of the boxes.

## Get started

Without further ado, why don't you spin up an instance of a box now and see it running for yourself.

We've put together a [very simple tutorial](developer/machine-box/tagbox/recognizing-images) where you will
use tagbox to identify the content of images - yes, it feels like magic and lies, but wait until you see what it can do.

## Meet the boxes

Each Machine Box product is a box (a Docker container that you can run) that contains everything you need to
