# Quick Start

This quick start is designed to take you through the process of registering a structured data schema. When completed, you can reference the schema when creating ingestion or processing jobs involving your structured data.

## Register a New Schema ##

Before using structured data in the Veritone platform, you need to register a schema for the data. The steps to do this:

1. Go to the Data section in the Developer App. You should see a page 
2. To register a new schema, click on the New button in the upper right portion of the page.
3. Fill in the required information about your schema.
4. Click on Next.
5. Copy and paste a valid Schema with valid JSON formatting. See the section below for more information about the requirements for schemas.
6. Click on Submit.
7. If your schema passed the validation, you will see a message pop up at the bottom of the page that says, "Data Schema created successfully!"
8. At this point, you can edit the information that you entered earlier about your schema if you like or just click on the x in the upper right to return to the My Schemas page where you can now see your schema is saved as Draft.
9. If you are happy with your schema, you can publish it by clicking on the vertical ellipses on the right hand side and selecting publish.
10. You will see a popup asking you to confirm that you want to publish the schema. Click "Publish" to confirm.
11. You'll be returned to the My Schema page where you'll see that your schema now has the status of Published. Once published, you can now use the schema to ingest structured data.
