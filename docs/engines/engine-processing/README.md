# Engine Processing Mode Overview

There are two processing modes an engine can run in:
- Message
- Stream

Message Processing should be utilized to consume fully actualized files such as static .mp3 files on your PC or .mp4 files in a Google Drive.

Stream Processing should be utilized when the ingested content is a live continuous feed such as .m3u8 HTTP Live Streams (HLS) or RTSP camera feeds.
