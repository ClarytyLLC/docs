# Engine Input/Output

When constructing your engine, you&rsquo;ll want to define the fields to accept as inputs and write as outputs for task processing. Each engine category in Veritone has a unique set of supported input types and required and optional input and output fields. The following pages define Metadata Output formats currently supported by Veritone Developer.

Feel free to contact us via e-mail or [Slack channel](https://chat.veritone.com) if your engine produces outputs that cannot easily be aligned with these standard output formats, and we will work with you to assess the feasibility of altering existing standards or creating a new category of accepted outputs.
