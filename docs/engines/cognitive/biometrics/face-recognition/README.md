Face recognition engines can analyze human faces in media assets, and score them as to similarity with known faces.

## Engine Manifest

All face recognition engines should specify the following parameters in their build manifest:

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| `TODO` | `TODO` |
| `TODO` | `TODO` |

Here is a minimal example `manifest.json` that could apply to a face recognition engine:

<!--TODO: Define [](manifest.example.json ':include :type=code javascript')-->

See the full documentation for [engine manifest standards](/engines/standards/engine-manifest/) for more details.

## Engine Input

<!-- TODO -->

## Engine Output

<!-- TODO -->

### Example
Here is an example of the simplest type of face recognition output:

[](vtn-standard.example.json ':include :type=code json')
