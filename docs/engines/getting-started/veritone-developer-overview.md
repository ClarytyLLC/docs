# Overview of Veritone Developer Application 

## aiWARE is Built for Developers
Veritone's aiWARE platform is purpose built for extensibility by developers on multiple levels.  In many ways our developer community is the lifeblood of the entire aiWARE software platform, enabling the platform to expand organically through the addition of new capabilities and functionality.  

Our goal is to make it possible for developers all all shapes and sizes to interact with and customize the platform through the Veritone Developer Application.  aiWARE can be a very effective tool to monetize existing software and algorithms, create new bespoke applications, develop methods of ingesting and processing virtually any type of data, integrate with our APIs, or add new data for training or correlation.

As a developer, Veritone can provide a distribution channel for your software products without the need for you to create all of the "plumbing" of a full software stack, or the need to directly market and sell to end-clients. If you choose, you can simply focus on developing killer algorithms, data sets, or applications on top of aiWARE.  Through Veritone, developers gain access to significant clients across industries on an international scale through our significant marketing and sales efforts.

Other developers may be more interested in building solutions for themselves or their organization by leveraging the Engines, App Packages, APIs, and Data Sets resident in aiWARE.

## Roadmap 
Like aiWARE itself, Developer Application continues to evolve rapidly.  Our goal is to support an ever-incresing spectrum of cognitive Classes and Capabilities over time.  Our future roadmap includes tools, reporting, and new functionality that will make it easier for developer partners to understand the platform, onboard their software, monitor usage, benchmark results, and iterate.  We want and need our partners to be succesful so your candid feedback is always welcome as we look to improve.  Look for novel innovations in the months to come - including App Packages, Workflow App, Virtuous Cycle, and Benchmarking (all explained below).

# Developer Personas
Veritone Developer Application has been designed to serve many different constituent groups and developer types, in conjunction with other ongoing platform features and capabilities available via aiWARE.  An overview of capabilities and features relevant to different types of developers is below.  

## For Engine Developers
In basic terms, "Cognitive Engine" is the term used by Veritone for software that facilitates the processing of data to produce metadata.  Most often an Engine will consist of a Docker container image containing executable code for a local ML algorithm or one hosted remotely and accessible via API.  Veritone Developer enables users to define a new engine conforming to engine Veritone specifications such as Class, Capability, Engine Processing Mode, Deployment Mode etc and then a series of Builds for that Engine.  After UAT and deployment by Veritone, an Engine becomes available to aiWARE users either as a Public or Private engine.

## For Application Developers
Veritone Developer enables users to extend the native capabilities of aiWARE by creating new unique applications, with or without a UI.  App developers can take advantage not only of Veritone's leading cognitive processing capabilities, but also modular UI elements, data and metadata storage, search functionality, data sets and other features.

### > App Packages (Coming Soon)
Veritone is currently working on a new toolkit that simplifies provisioning, management and distribution of user-facing solutions on top of aiWARE. All necessary App components can be easily grouped and associated with a new Package entity within Developer.Â Packages allow developers to discover available components, build and improve your application incrementally, prototype a solution with limited or no code required, add or replace components as they become available, and manage your app requirements and dependencies all in one place.

## For Dataset Providers
Datasets can take several forms within Developer App, and Veritone continues to add new features and functionality to extend capabilities related to making useful datasets avaialble for model training, augmentation of or correlation to metadata, or to add context to the UI presentation of cognitive processing. Our roadmap includes a marketplace for data to enable users to license their data products within Developer App.

## For IT Professionals
Veritone Developer is useful to Systems Integrators and internal IT departments to build and deploy integrations to existing or new systems and platforms using Veritone's APIs.  They can also integrate proprietary engines, applicatations and datasets to customize aiWARE to specific use cases. 

### > Workflow Application (Coming Soon)
Veritone Workflow is a new application that makes it easy to define custom, event-based workflows using the multitude of tools and elements resident in aiWARE.

## For Data Scientists
Developer App is currently used by in-house Data Scientists and external DS teams to rapidly deploy the results of their modeling, and to enable end users to utilize the resulting cognitive processing for existing use cases and entirely new, bespoke data analysis projects.  Veritone continues to iterate on tools and functionality relevant to Data Scientists, including Virtuous Cycle and Benchmarking as outlined below.

### > Virtuous Cycle (Coming Soon)
Veritone is actively working toward a workflow embedded in aiWARE that will enable continuous training and validation of certain types of trainable Engines, including a human-in-the-loop component.  The benefit of this Virtuous Cycle will be the ability to custom train some engines specifically on real client data such that accuracy improves incrementally over time.

### > Benchmarking (Coming Soon)
Our developer community has provided valuable feedback that understanding how Engines stack up against others within a given Capability is very important to iterative improvement over time - which benefits you as a developer and Veritone by extension.  We are working on exposing the results of our programmatic benchmarking in Developer Application in an elegant way that will provide insight into your specific engine performance and cost in the context of other (anonymized) competitors and colleagues.
