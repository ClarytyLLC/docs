Overview of Veritone Developer Application 

## aiWARE is Built for Developers
Veritone's aiWARE platform is purpose built for extensibility by developers on multiple levels.  In many ways our developer community is the lifeblood of the entire aiWARE software platform, enabling the platform to expand organically through the addition of new capabilities and functionality.  

Our goal is to make it possible for developers all all shapes and sizes to interact with and customize the platform through the Veritone Developer Application.  aiWARE can be a very effective tool to monetize existing software and algorithms, create new bespoke applications, develop methods of ingesting and processing virtually any type of data, integrate with our APIs, or add new data for training or correlation.

As a developer, Veritone can provide a distribution channel for your software products without the need for you to create all of the "plumbing" of a full software stack, or the need to directly market and sell to end-clients. If you choose, you can simply focus on developing killer algorithms, data sets, or applications on top of aiWARE.  Through Veritone, developers gain access to significant clients across industries on an international scale through our significant marketing and sales efforts.

Other developers may be more interested in building solutions for themselves or their organization by leveraging the Engines, App Packages, APIs, and Data Sets resident in aiWARE.

## Roadmap 
Like aiWARE itself, Developer Application continues to evolve rapidly.  Our goal is to support an ever-incresing spectrum of cognitive Classes and Capabilities over time.  Our future roadmap includes tools, reporting, and new functionality that will make it easier for developer partners to understand the platform, onboard their software, monitor usage, benchmark results, and iterate.  We want and need our partners to be succesful so your candid feedback is always welcome as we look to improve.

Veritone Developer Application has been designed to serve many different constituent groups and developer types, in conjunction with other ongoing platform features and capabilities available via aiWARE.  An overview of capabilities and features relevant to different developer personas is below.  

## Engine Developers
In basic terms, "Cognitive Engine" is the term used by Veritone for software that facilitates the processing of data to produce metadata.  Most often an Engine will consist of a Docker container image containing executable code for a local ML algorithm or one hosted remotely and accessible via API.  Veritone Developer enables users to define a new engine conforming to engine Veritone specifications such as Class, Capability, Engine Processing Mode, Deployment Mode etc and then a series of Builds for that Engine.  After UAT and deployment by Veritone, an Engine becomes available to aiWARE users either as a Public or Private engine.

## Application Developers
Veritone Developer enables users to extend the native capabilities of aiWARE by creating new unique applications, with or without a UI.  App developers can take advantage not only of Veritone's leading cognitive processing capabilities, but also modular UI elements, data and metadata storage, search functionality, data sets and other features.

### App Packages (Coming Soon)
Veritone is currently working on a new toolkit that simplifies provisioning, management and distribution of user-facing solutions on top of aiWARE. All necessary App components can be easily grouped and associated with a new Package entity within Developer.Â 

## Dataset Providers
Datasets can take several forms within Developer App, and Veritone continues to add new features and functionality to extend capabilities related to making useful datasets avaialble for model training, augmentation of or correlation to metadata, or to add context to the UI presentation of cognitive processing. Our roadmap includes a marketplace for data to enable users to license their data products within Developer App.

## IT Professionals
Veritone Developer is useful to Systems Integrators and internal IT departments to build and deploy integrations to existing or new systems and platforms using Veritone's APIs.  They can also integrate proprietary engines, applicatations and datasets to customize aiWARE to specific use cases.
