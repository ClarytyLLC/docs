Overview of Veritone Developer Application 

## Developers Role in aiWARE
Veritone's aiWARE platform is purpose built for extensibility by developers on multiple levels.  In many ways our developer community is the lifeblood of the entire aiWARE software platform, enabling the platform to expand organically through the addition of new capabilities and functionality.  Our goal is to make it possible for developers all all shapes and sizes to interact with the platform through the Developer Application in an intuitive and efficient way.  aiWARE can be a very effective tool to monetize existing software and algorithms, create new bespoke applications, develop methods of ingesting and processing virtually any type of data, or add new data for training or correlation.

## Roadmap 
Like aiWARE itself, Developer Application continues to evolve rapidly.  Our goal is to support an ever-incresing spectrum of cognitive Classes and Capabilities over time.  Our future roadmap includes tools, reporting, and new functionality that will make it easier for developer partners to understand the platform, onboard their software, monitor usage, benchmark results, and iterate.  We want and need our partners to be succesful so your candid feedback is always welcome as we look to improve.

Veritone Developer Application has been designed to serve many different constituent groups and developer types, in conjunction with other ongoing platform features and capabilities available via aiWARE.
